# Hotel-Revenue-with-Predictive-Analytics

I want to share a recent project where I applied machine learning and data analysis to forecast the Average Daily Rate (ADR) for hotel bookings. ADR is a key performance indicator for revenue management in the hospitality industry. By predicting ADR, hotels can optimize pricing, boost revenue, and plan their operations more effectively.

üîç Key Insights:

Seasonality & Trends: ADR follows a predictable seasonal pattern, peaking during mid-year months (especially August). Recognizing these trends allows hotels to plan pricing strategies in advance.

Dynamic Pricing: The positive relationship between ADR and booking volume highlights the importance of adjusting room rates based on demand‚Äîraise prices during high-demand periods and offer discounts when demand is low.

Model Performance: After evaluating multiple models, Random Forest proved to be the best performer for ADR predictions, with superior accuracy compared to other models like XGBoost and LightGBM.

üí° Business Impact:

Revenue Optimization: Predicting ADR helps in setting the right price, ensuring maximum profitability.

Proactive Planning: Insights from predictions enable better inventory management and targeted promotions.

Competitive Advantage: Dynamic pricing and tailored promotions give hotels an edge in an ever-changing market.

This project underscores the power of data science in driving business decisions. With accurate ADR forecasting, hotels can not only enhance their revenue management strategies but also deliver a better guest experience.
